This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.



#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (4 == 4)
print(d)
f = (3 == 3)
print(f)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = (2 < 3)
print(a)
j = (3 < 2)
print(j)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c = ( 4 > 3)
print(c)
l = ( 4 > 2)
print(l)


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 2
x = 3 
h = (x >= y)
print(h)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5
x = 3
g = (x <= y)
print(g)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
v = (4 == 5)
prnt(v)
