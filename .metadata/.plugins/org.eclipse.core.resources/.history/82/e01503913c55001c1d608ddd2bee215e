#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
integer

a = 5
print(a)

a = 4 
print(a)

a = 3
print (a)

float

a = 3.45 
 
a = 5.43

a = 4.32

string 

a = "Samantha"

a = "Michael"

a = "Nino"

a = "Samantha and Michael"

boolean

a = True

a = False

a = [1, 2,3, 4,]
print (a)

varA = 1
vara = 2

var = 4
var = "string"

varTwo = var
print(varTwo)

b = [a, varA, var]

print(b)

list = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(list[0])

listVar = list(0)
print(listVar)
 
string = "Samantha"
print(string[0])

print(5)
print(True)
print(list)


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

print(a)
print(A)

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
a = "Lia"


b = "Lia"
#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
print(var)
var = 4


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

a = 4
a = 1
a = 7

print(a)




#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
string = "Maria"

print(M)

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

a = 5

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors


var = 5
print(var)
