#1) Make a function that has two boolean parameters. If both booleans are
#true, return true. Else, return false. Then, call the function.
#Print what the function returns.
def sumTwoNum(numOne, numTwo):
    answer = numOne + numTwo
    return answer

x = 2
y = 3
sumTwoNum(x,y)

print(sumTwoNum(x,y))

#2) Make a function that takes one int parameter: gallons. Convert gallons
#to cups (do this by multiplying gallons by 16). Then return cups. Then,
#call the function.
#Print what the function returns.
def function(gallons, cups):
    answer = gallons + cups
    return answer
    
    
    


#3) Make a function of any any kind with a common SYNTAX error. Then, call the
#function.
#Print what the function returns.
def function(Maria, McFadden):
    answer = Maria + McFadden
    return answer
