#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
stringVar = " Hello World! "
print ("this is a string:" + stringVar)


#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 + 4
print(x)


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 - 1
print(x)


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 3.33 - 1.33
print(x)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 * 2
print(x)


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
stringVar = " Hello * World"
print ("this is a string:" + stringVar)


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 16 / 4
print(x)


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 17.5 / 3
print(x)


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 6 % 3
print(x)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 5 // 5
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 ** 2
print(x)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

x = "hello world"
print(x)
